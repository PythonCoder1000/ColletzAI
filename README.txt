You can delete this after the trip cuz im uploading all this stuff anyways =)



This project is based on the colletz conjecture, 
which states that in the series if n is even then n / 2 and if n is odd then 3n + 1
the ending result will always be 1, which leads to 4, which leads to 2, leading back to 1.
The conjecture (unproven) says that no number, n, can enter another loop or avoid going into the 4 2 1 loop

This project uses a simple brute force to calculate values of colletz conjecture. I plan to use ML to "predict" the number of steps
for a certain starting value, n.
